> The GitHub syntax theme generator will generate themes for multiple platforms based on the GitHub syntax theme.

## Install

All of the built themes in this package are distributed at separate repositories. It's recommended that you install one of these if you're looking for a specific theme.

### CSS

The CSS syntax theme is based on a custom syntax highlighter in use by GitHub. The prefixes to the classes are `.pl-` for Prettylights.

- [github-syntax-light]()
- [github-syntax-dark]()

### [Ace][ace]

The [Ace][ace] syntax theme is generated using a built in tool by Ace to convert [TextMate][tm] themes to Ace themes.

- [github-ace-light]()
- [github-ace-dark]()

### [Atom][atom]

The [Atom][atom] theme is built by `apm` converted from the [TextMate][tm] theme.

- [github-light-syntax]()
- [github-dark-syntax]()

### [TextMate][tm]

- [github-textmate-light]()
- [github-textmate-dark]()
